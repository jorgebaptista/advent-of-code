# Instalation/Run

* Install Python. General way can be by downloading from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* If using Windows make sure the location of Python interpreter is included in the PATH environment variable. See Python Docs on [Setting environment variables](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#excursus-setting-environment-variables).
* You need to use your own input file. Rename it like **inputX.txt**, where X stands for the day of the puzzle.
* Open the terminal inside this folder and run "**python main.py**".
