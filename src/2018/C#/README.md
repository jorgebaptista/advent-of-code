# Instalation/Run

* Install the [.Net Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
* You need to use your own input file. Rename it like **inputX.txt**, where X stands for the day of the puzzle.
* Open the terminal inside this folder and run "**dotnet restore**" to restore necessary project files not included in the repository.
* Run "**dotnet run**" in the terminal.
